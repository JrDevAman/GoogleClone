This project is a dark-themed clone of the Google homepage, created using HTML and CSS. The design mimics the minimalist style of Google’s interface while incorporating a modern dark background and white logo. Key elements include a centered search bar, responsive buttons for "Google Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky," and subtle hover effects on interactive components.
The dark theme provides a visually appealing, user-friendly experience that aligns with current trends in web design, while the layout stays true to the simplicity of Google’s iconic look. This project is an exercise in front-end development fundamentals, emphasizing CSS styling, layout positioning, and user interaction effects.
With this Google clone, I aimed to practice and showcase foundational skills in HTML and CSS, focusing on structured layout design and responsive UI elements.
